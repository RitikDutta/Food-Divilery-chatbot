# Food Delivery Chatbot

## The Problem
- Managing a food delivery startup becomes challenging when the daily orders increase beyond 20-30.
- Manual handling of orders can lead to repeated interactions with customers.
- A solution is needed to efficiently manage and respond to customer orders.

## Chatbot Types
- Two types of chatbots: Hard-coded and AI-based.
- Hard-coded chatbots rely on exact phrases and are less customer-friendly.
- AI-based chatbots understand customer intentions, making them more reliable and customer-friendly.

## Chatbot Features
- Created using Dialogflow and linked with Google Sheets for inventory management.
- Maintains a customer database with order history for tracking delivery status.
- Suitable for use as a chatbot for food delivery businesses.

## How to Use the Chatbot
1. The chatbot greets and displays the available menu.
2. Customers can add items to their order by saying "make an order."
3. Customers provide their name, which is added to the database.
4. The first order is mandatory.
5. Additional items can be added using commands like "add plain maggie."
6. Customers can review their cart, displaying the order list with individual amounts and the total.
7. To place the order, customers can say "place the order."
8. The bot confirms the order, and customers can respond with "yes" or "no."
9. The bot updates the spreadsheet database based on customer responses.
10. A smart feature prevents new customers from ordering while another customer is in the process to avoid interruptions.
